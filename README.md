# Pragmatic Guide to Maven 3

This is my attempt at writing a book about Maven following the format of the Pragmatic Guide books (such as http://pragprog.com/titles/pg_git/pragmatic-guide-to-git) published by The Pragmatic Bookshelf (http://pragprog.com/)

## Requirements

- Ruby

## Setup

To build the book:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spilth/maven-book.git
    $ cd maven-book
    $ bundle
    $ rake
    $ open target/pragmatic-guide-to-maven.pdf
